This is the source code repository for the [KalaKit website](http://thekalakit.com) and [Elypso Engine website](http://elypsoengine.com) which is where all the documentation for the KalaKit libraries and Elypso Engine will be hosted at. 

These websites are hosted with [KalaServer](https://github.com/KalaKit/KalaServer) and you can see how it works from the [server](/server) folder.

These websites are currently under construction and are not yet live 24/7 so please be patient as they are being brought up to date.
